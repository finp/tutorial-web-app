:walkthrough: Integrating event-driven and API-driven applications (EnMasse)


// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id='integrating-eventdriven-and-apidriven-applications-enmasse']
// If the assembly is reused in other assemblies in a guide, include {context} in the ID: [id='a-collection-of-modules-{context}'].

// Book Title
= {walkthrough}

//If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund form, such as Creating or Configuring.
:context: integrating-eventdriven-and-apidriven-applications-enmasse
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
