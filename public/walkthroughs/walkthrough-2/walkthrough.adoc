= Integrating API-driven applications

:context: integrating-api-driven-applications

Integrate an API that provides flight information, ensuring that the API is protected and rate limited.

APIs are the ideal channel for organizations who want to reach audiences whenever, wherever, and however they choose.
This enables innovation, mobile and partner development.
However, it also exposes the hosting infrastructure and organization.
It is possible to protect and limit access to an API using {api-mgmt-service} as part of your integration.

This walkthrough describes how to create such an integration, using OpenShift, {launcher-service}, {che-service} and {api-mgmt-service}.

=== Deploying the Fuse Aggregation App


// TODO placeholders for product names
// TODO append /launch/wizard/<project-name> to launcher url
// TODO flights endpoint url
. Log in to the link:{launcher-url}/launch/wizard/{walkthrough-namespace}[{launcher-service}, window="_blank"] wizard.

. Select the option to *Code Locally, Build and Deploy* in the *Select Target Environment* step.

. Select the *Authorize* button to allow Launcher create resources in the OpenShift cluster. This triggers an OAuth flow, and eventually redirects back to the {launcher-service} wizard.

. Select the blue down-arrow icon to continue the wizard.

. Select the *Aggregation* mission and *Fuse* runtime in the *Select Mission & Runtime* step

. Select the blue down-arrow icon to continue the wizard.

. Authorize your Github Account
.. Select the *Log In & Authorize Account* button in the *Authorize Git Provider* step.
.. This opens a Github OAuth page.
