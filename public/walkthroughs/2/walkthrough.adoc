= Integrating API-driven applications



:context: integrating-api-driven-applications


Integrate an API that provides flight information, ensuring that the API is protected and rate limited.

APIs are the ideal channel for organizations who want to reach audiences whenever, wherever, and however they choose. 
This enables innovation, mobile and partner development.  
However, it also exposes the hosting infrastructure and organization. 
It is possible to protect and limit access to an API using {api-mgmt-service} as part of your integration.

This walkthrough describes how to create such an integration, using OpenShift, {launcher-service}, {che-service} and {api-mgmt-service}.
